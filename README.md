## User Story
    AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
    SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

  ## Description
    GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
    WHEN I load the portfolio
    THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
    WHEN I view the header
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
    WHEN I view the navigation titles
    THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
    WHEN I click on a navigation title
    THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
    WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
    THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
    WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
    THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
    WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
    THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
    WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
    THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
    WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
    THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
    WHEN I enter text into the email address field
    THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
    WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
    THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
    WHEN I view the footer
    THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
